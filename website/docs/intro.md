# Tutorial Intro

This tutorial aims to bridge the gap between the familiar `http.Handler` concept and the complete workings
of the Kubernetes apiserver.

In the first chapter, weâ€™ll cover how to build a functional Kubernetes API-style HTTP server using the [kubernetes/apiserver][kubernetes-apiserver] package.

## Who This Tutorial Is For

1. Go developers (with basic knowledge of building an HTTP server)
2. Developers interested in Kubernetes apimachinery
